# Today I Learned

![Today I Learned Website Image](./img/Today-I-Learned.png)

A fully responsive web page about showing and sharing of interesting facts.
A hosted version of this page (on Netlify) can be accessed [here](https://66f01edd33a5bbaebe3d39bc--exquisite-churros-d78927.netlify.app/).

These are the currently available features:

- Sharing a fact (posting a fact, with a **valid** HTTP source link)
- Filtering available facts by fact type
- Voting facts as Interesting, Mindblowing, or to deny it with the False Vote
- False votes become _Disputed_, and end at the end of the facts list
